# Python_OAuth2.0_APIRequest_Example

This file is a working example of how you can request an access token from your tenants access token url and use that token to make an API request.

Be sure to update the sections in the script file like this: '<< SAAK value from .ionapi >>' to use your credentials from the .ionapi file you downloaded when you created a backend service.
